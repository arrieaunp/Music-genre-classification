Music Genre Classification Project
This project aims to classify music genres using audio features and machine learning models. It explores the use of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as the primary audio feature and evaluates the performance of various classifiers including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
