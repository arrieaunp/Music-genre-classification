Music Genre Classification Project
This project aims to classify music genres using audio features and machine learning models. It explores the use of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as the primary audio feature and evaluates the performance of various classifiers including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Key Features
> Feature Extraction: Extracts MFCCs from audio files using the Librosa library.
> Machine Learning Models: Trains and evaluates multiple classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, KNN, CNN).
> Classification Performance: Provides accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports to assess model effectiveness.
> Data Exploration: Optionally includes visualizations to understand audio data and features.

Results
Model	Test Accuracy
- Random Forest	55%
- SVM	49%
- KNN	47%
- CNN	56%
